    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These smoky and tender beef BBQ ribs are the perfect combination of succulent, fall-off-the-bone meat and rich, smoky flavors. The ribs are first marinated in a flavorful blend of spices, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar, then slow-cooked on the grill to create a juicy, tender, and mouthwatering dish that's perfect for any barbecue or outdoor gathering.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds beef ribs, separated into individual ribs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for a spicy kick)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups BBQ sauce of your choice (for basting and serving)</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, ground cumin, kosher salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using) to create the dry rub.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and extra virgin olive oil to make the marinade.</li>
        <li>Pat the beef ribs dry with paper towels and arrange them on a large tray or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Rub the dry spice mixture evenly onto both sides of the ribs, ensuring that they are fully coated.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the marinade over the ribs, and using your hands, massage it into the meat. Make sure the ribs are well-coated with the marinade.</li>
        <li>Cover the tray with plastic wrap and refrigerate the ribs for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium-low heat (around 250째F or 120째C). If using a charcoal grill, arrange the coals for indirect grilling.</li>
        <li>Remove the ribs from the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the ribs on the grill, bone-side down, over indirect heat. Close the lid and cook for 2.5 to 3 hours, turning the ribs occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>During the last 30 minutes of grilling, baste the ribs with your chosen BBQ sauce, turning and basting every 10 minutes to build up a nice glaze.</li>
        <li>The ribs are done when they are tender and the meat easily pulls away from the bone. Check the internal temperature using a meat thermometer; it should read around 190째F or 88째C.</li>
        <li>Remove the ribs from the grill and let them rest for 10 minutes before slicing into individual pieces.</li>
        <li>Serve the beef BBQ ribs with additional BBQ sauce on the side and your favorite sides, such as coleslaw, cornbread, or baked beans.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Enjoy your smoky and tender beef BBQ ribs!</p>
