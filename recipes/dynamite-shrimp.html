            <li>1 cup ice-cold water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour (for dusting)</li>
            <li>Oil for deep frying (canola, vegetable, or peanut oil)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Dynamite sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
        </ul>  

        <h3>For Garnish</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Green onions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dynamite sauce by combining the mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, honey, rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic powder, and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Mix well and adjust the seasoning to taste. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, combine the tempura batter mix and ice-cold water. Stir gently until combined, but do not overmix. The batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oil for deep frying in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer to 350°F (175°C). Ensure there is enough oil to submerge the shrimp completely.</li>
            <li>Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel and lightly coat them in the all-purpose flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
            <li>Dip each floured shrimp into the tempura batter, letting any excess batter drip off.</li>
            <li>Carefully lower the battered shrimp into the hot oil, frying in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for 2-3 minutes or until the shrimp are golden brown and cooked through. Use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp from the oil and transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
            <li>Once all the shrimp are fried, place them in a large bowl and pour the dynamite sauce over them. Gently toss the shrimp to coat them evenly with the sauce.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dynamite shrimp to a serving platter and garnish with sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
